Hey everyone,

This is a pretty simple scraper. I modified a version I found out online, so follow these steps to install:

1) download the repo as a zip file
2) unzip the file
3) Open google chrome
4) click on extensions
5) Manage extensions
6) Load Unpacked
7) upload the whole folder
8) add in your api Key
